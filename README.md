# Project name: Shear Systematics Emulation


#Topical Team: wl-shear, STAR

Emulation is a tractable way of producing realizations of observed shear catalog that covers a wide footprint, which is beneficial for testing the cosmic shear/3x2pt. The emulator learns from CosmoDC2 catalog, DC2 image simulation, and data from precursor surveys such as HSC. In this project, we focus on emulating PSF systematics that affect galaxy shape and detectability.
